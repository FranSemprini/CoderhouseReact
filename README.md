# E-STORE APP (Still working on it)

Coder House - React course final assessment
Deployed on Netlify

## Libraries / APIS's used

Firestore Database
Firebase Authentication
Toastify
(A litle bit of) Material UI

## How to use / How does it work?

To start you must create an account (or use yours). Don't worry, it can be any fake email account as you won't need to validate it.

Once you log in you will be free to "shop" on the website. Every purchase is logged in Firestore and the stock of the products will decrease.

Note, if you buy something and it runs out during the checkout process, you will receive a message about the item missing and the transaction will be canceled.
